# Hi, I'm Alex Rodrigues üëã ![Alex Rodrigues](/images/alex.png)

I'm a **Applied AI Engineer** with over 10 years of experience delivering data-driven applications and AI-powered systems across industries. I specialize in **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, back-end development, and LLM-based architectures, helping companies turn raw data into actionable intelligence through scalable, production-ready solutions.

I‚Äôve worked with companies in both **Brazil and the United States**, delivering AI products that go far beyond prototypes. From LLM fine-tuning and vector search optimization to integrating AI into mission-critical systems, I focus on building things that actually ship.

This blog is a place where I share what I‚Äôve learned, not from theory, but from the real trenches of AI engineering.

## My Focus

- üíª Applied Machine Learning & Back-End Engineering  
- ü§ñ GenAI, LangChain, RAG, Vector Search and Prompt Optimization  
- üß† Scaling LLM systems with LangGraph, LangSmith, Hugging Face  and more  
- üß∞ Building high-performance pipelines with FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes and more
- üîç Communicating complex systems clearly for both technical and business stakeholders  

## Experience Snapshot

I currently work for U.S. based companies, developing scalable RAG systems, deploying containerized LLM solutions, and integrating GenAI into real-world product lines. I previously led GenAI initiatives at large-scale organizations, delivering production-grade AI systems that improved decision-making, recommendation engines, and internal automation.

Before diving deep into AI architecture, I worked as a **Senior Data Scientist** in roles involving forecasting, analytics, and data storytelling, experience that shaped my pragmatic, impact-driven approach to building systems.
