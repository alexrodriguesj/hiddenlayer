OpenAI has unveiled **Codex**, a cloud-based AI coding agent integrated into ChatGPT, designed to automate various software development tasks. Powered by the new **codex-1** model, Codex can:

- **Write and Edit Code**: Generate new features and modify existing codebases.
- **Debug and Test**: Identify bugs and run tests to ensure code reliability.
- **Understand Codebases**: Answer questions about a project's code structure and functionality.
- **Propose Pull Requests**: Suggest code changes for review and integration.

Codex operates within a secure, isolated environment, preloaded with the user's repository, and can handle multiple tasks in parallel, typically completing them within 1 to 30 minutes. Initially available to ChatGPT Pro, Team, and Enterprise users, OpenAI plans to expand access to Plus and Edu subscribers soon. This launch positions OpenAI competitively in the AI-assisted software development space, alongside tools from Anthropic and Google. ([openai.com](https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/))
