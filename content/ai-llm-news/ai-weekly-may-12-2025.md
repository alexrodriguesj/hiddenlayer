EdTech firm **Chegg** is laying off 248 employees, about 22% of its workforce, after a steep drop in subscribers and revenue. The company attributes this decline to competition from AI tools like ChatGPT, which can answer homework questions for free.

Chegg also filed a lawsuit against Google, alleging that AI summaries reduced traffic to its original content. The company reported a 31% decline in subscribers and a 30% drop in revenue for Q1 2025.
