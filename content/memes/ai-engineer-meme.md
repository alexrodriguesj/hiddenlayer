# What People Think AI Engineers Do (vs Reality) 
{{< blog-image src="/images/ai_meme_01.png" alt="AI Engineer Meme" >}}

We’ve all seen those memes that contrast “What people think I do vs What I really do.”  
So I made one for the **AI Engineer** role, because honestly, the misconceptions are getting out of hand.

Let’s break them down:

---

## 🧠 What my coworkers think I do  
*“Talk to ChatGPT all day.”*  
To be fair, this happens. But it’s not the core of the job. Prompting is not engineering.

---

## 📈 What my clients think I do  
*“Use a crystal ball to generate magical business insights.”*  
Expectations are often sky-high. They want dashboards powered by LLMs, instantly, with zero context or data cleanup.

---

## 🎩 What recruiters think I do  
*“LLM + Python + 2 weeks = AI product.”*  
The classic underestimation of the real complexity behind even the smallest deployment.

---

## 🕹️ What my boss thinks I do  
*“Let the LLM do the work while I play games.”*  
Automation is powerful, but someone still has to design, test, monitor, and fix it at 2AM...

---

## 🤖 What I think I do  
*“Architect AGI with fine-tuned transformer ops.”*  
Let me dream. Sometimes, I *do* feel like I’m building the future.

---

## 🧟 What I really do  
*“Debug prompt injection in a legacy system at 2AM.”*  
This is the most honest panel of them all.  
Dirty data, undocumented code, unpredictable LLM behavior, welcome to AI in production.

### 💬 Final thoughts

The AI Engineer role is still misunderstood — often romanticized, underestimated, or oversimplified. It’s not just about prompts, or training GPT clones. It’s engineering: systems, pipelines, latency, logging, versioning, and everything in between.

If you're getting into this field, or working in it and feeling frustrated: **you're not alone**.

This blog exists to share that reality. Every week. With code, insights, failures and lessons.
